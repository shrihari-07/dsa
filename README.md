# LeetCode Problems by Data Structure

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by data structure. The goal is to keep a well-organized collection of problem solutions that are easy to navigate, understand, and reference. Each solution is implemented with a focus on readability, efficiency, and adherence to best coding practices.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
```
|----- array/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|----- linked-list/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|----- strings/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|----- dynamic-programming/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|----- tree/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|----- graph/
|  |----- 1. Problem Name1.py
|  |----- 2. Problem Name2.py
|  |_____ .....
|_____ README.md
```

Each directory contains the solutions to problems specific to that data structure. The solution files are named after the problem title and contains problem statement along with the solution implementation in python programming language.

## How to Use
1. **Navigate** to the folder corresponding to the data structure you're interested in.
2. **Open** the problem file to read a detailed explanation of the problem and the solution.
3. **Review** the code block to see the implementation.
